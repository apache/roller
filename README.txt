   Roller is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software 
   Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects 
   until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, 
   and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with 
   other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a 
   reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate 
   that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
