Abstract implementation of the business layer interfaces.

<p>At this level we avoid dependance on specific persistence engines 
(e.g. Hibernate). We do this by using an interface named 
{@link org.apache.roller.business.PersistenceStrategy PersistenceStrategy}
to store, retrieve and remove 
{@link org.apache.roller.pojos.PersistentObject PersistentObjects}.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates the dependency relationships between the 
{@link org.apache.roller.pojos org.apache.roller.pojos},
{@link org.apache.roller.model org.apache.roller.model}, and
org.apache.roller.business packages.</p>
