<p>
The org.roller.presentation package and the packages under it comprise the 
<b>Presentation Layer</b> - the web-based Roller user interface.
 
The code in the packages depend on Web APIs including the Servlet API, JSP API, 
Struts, Velocity and the like. 
</p>

<p>
These packages are also the home of Roller's Web Services interfaces -
both the XML-RPC based Blogger/MetaWeblog APIs and the REST based Atom API
Web Service interfaces are suppported.

Generally speaking, the code in these packages implements presentation logic
and presentation logic only.

Wherever possible, application logic that can be made independent of Web APIs
is implemented inside the Business Layer
