DRAFT STATUS:  Please note that this document itself is a preliminary draft for the status file.
It requires at least an initial review by the other committers and by our incubation
Mentor.

the Incubation Policy document (http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html),
specifically with respect to the Minimum Exit Requirements
(http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html#Minimum+Exit+Requirements),
and any additional requirements imposed by the Incubator PMC.

MINIMUM EXIT REQUIREMENTS

Listed below are the minimum exit requirements (from the Incubation Policy document).
With each requirement are notes regarding our status towards completion of
the requirement.

LEGAL
* All code ASL'ed
    INCOMPLETE. We have a top-level ASL, but not all source files have had a notice added to them.
* No non ASL or ASL compatbile dependencies in the code base
    INCOMPLETE. We have dependencies on some LGPL code, notably Hibernate, and the JSPWiki plugin.
* License grant complete
    UNKNOWN.  We believe this is complete.  Mentor, please verify.
* CLAs on file.
    COMPLETE.  CLAs for all current committers are on file.
* Check of project name for trademark issues
    UNKNOWN. We believe the Roller Weblogger name to be free of trademark issues. Will Apache Legal be responsible to
    confirm?  If not, what verification should be undertaken by project developers?

MERITOCRACY
* Demonstrate an active and diverse development community
    BELIEVED COMPLETE.  We believe we satisfy this today with our current set of committers, and we are open to additional
    qualified developers.
* The project is not highly dependent on any single contributor (there's at least 3 legally independent committers and
  there is no single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project).
    BELIEVED COMPLETE.  We believe we satisfy this today with the current set of committers.
* The above implies that new committers are admitted according to ASF practices
    ONGOING.  We will admit new committers according to ASF practices.
* ASF style voting has been adopted and is standard practice
    ONGOING.  We have been using ASF-style voting since before our entry into incubation, and we plan to maintain this
    practice with some additional rigor / regularity.
* Demonstrate ability to tolerate and resolve conflict within the community.
    ONGOING.  The community has been able to do this successfully to date.  There has been very little in the way of
    conflict however.  We use the development mailing list for discussions and request votes as necessary.
* Release plans are developed and excuted in public by the community.
    ONGOING.  We use the mailing lists to announce release plans and accept comments.
* Note: incubator projects are not permitted to issue an official Release. Test snapshots (however good the quality) and
  Release plans are OK.
    NOTED.  We will likely wish to release "test snapshots" with "incubating" clearly noted in the packaging.
* Destination PMC, or ASF Board for a TLP, has voted for final acceptance
    INCOMPLETE.  This will be our final step (or among them), after meeting other requirements.

ALIGNMENT / SYNERGY
* Use of other ASF subprojects
    BELIEVED COMPLETE.  Roller depends on at least the following Apache components: Struts,  Velocity (Jakarta), Lucene,
    Log4j (Logging), some elements of the Jakarta Commons libraries.  In addition, we favor Tomcat as a servlet container,
    to the extent that we provide primary installation guide documentation and additional user support for configuring
    Roller on Tomcat. We also depend on the Rome project components (RSS/Atom support) which we expect will be in
    incubation during a period overlapping that of the Roller project.
* Develop synergistic relationship with other ASF subprojects
    UNKNOWN.  We're great at using the other ASF stuff; hopefully we'll find ways to give back.

INFRASTRUCTURE
* CVS module has been created
    COMPLETE. SVN module has been created at https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/roller/trunk/
* Mailing list(s) have been created
    COMPLETE. Roller developer list (roller-dev@incubator.apache.org) and Roller user list
    (roller-user@incubator.apache.org).
* Mailing lists are being archived
    INCOMPLETE.  Mentor, please help.
* Bugzilla has been created
    BELIEVED INCOMPLETE.  We need both to add Roller to the appropriate Bugzilla and to migrate from
    our current issue tracking (http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/roller/).
* Project website has been created
    INCOMPLETE.
* Project ready to comply with ASF mirroring guidlines
    INCOMPLETE.
* Project is integrated with GUMP if appropriate
    INCOMPLETE.
* Releases are PGP signed by a member of the community
    INCOMPLETE.
* Developers tied into ASF PGP web of trust
    INCOMPLETE.
