/**
* Unified backend for ExtendedFileManager - copied from ImageManager
*
* Image Manager was originally developed by:
*   Xiang Wei Zhuo, email: xiangweizhuo(at)hotmail.com Wei Shou.
*
* Unified backend sponsored by DTLink Software, http://www.dtlink.com
* Implementation by Yermo Lamers, http://www.formvista.com
*
* (c) DTLink, LLC 2005.
* Distributed under the same terms as HTMLArea itself.
* This notice MUST stay intact for use (see license.txt).
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*
* Instead of using separate URL's for each function, ImageManager now
* routes all requests to the server through this single, replaceable,
* entry point. backend.php expects at least two URL variable parameters: 
*
* __plugin=ImageManager   for future expansion; identify the plugin being requested.
* __function=thumbs|images|editorFrame|editor|manager  function being called.
*
* Having a single entry point that strictly adheres to a defined interface will 
* make the backend code much easier to maintain and expand. It will make it easier
* on integrators, not to mention it'll make it easier to have separate 
* implementations of the backend in different languages (Perl, Python, ASP, etc.) 
*
* @see config.inc.php
