----------------------

Usage:
  1. Follow the standard procedure for loading a plugin.
  2. You may configure the plugin by setting the following configuration variables, or leave them as the defaults.

      xinha_config.FormOperations.multiple_field_format
        = 'php'
              this will cause checkbox and "multiple" select fields to have []
              appended to thier field names silently
        = 'unmodified'
              field names will not be silently modified

      xinha_config.FormOperations.allow_edit_form
        = true
              the user will be able to edit the action, and method of forms
        = false
              neither action, nor method is editable

      xinha_config.FormOperations.default_form_action
        = 'whatever you want'
              the default form action to set when inserting a form.  The standard one is a php file in the Form Operations directory which will email the form post to enquiries@<server hostname here>

      xinha_config.FormOperations.default_form_html
        = '<form>whatever you want here</form>'
              the default html to insert when inserting a form.  The standard one is a basic contact form.  If you would like to specify an external file which contains the HTML for the form, you may do so via
              = HTMLArea._geturlcontent('http://absolute/url/to/file.html')
              see default_form.html for a suitable example, pay attention to the form tag.
