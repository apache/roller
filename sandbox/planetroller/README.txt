README.txt for Roller Planet

   Planet Roller is a code-name for a new set of features for Roller, features that 
   make it easy to build aggregated weblogs. 

Planet Tool

   Currently, we have only PlanetTool, a command-line tool that can be used to 
   generated an aggregated weblog. PlanetTool can be run as a scheduled-task, 
   generating static HTML, RSS, and OPML files right into a web server directory.

   You don't need Roller to use the Planet Tool.

   All you need to do is to provide your own Planet Config file 
   (e.g. planet-config.xml) and use it on the command-line when you 
   run planet-tool.sh.

   For more information on the config file and on page templates see this blog entry:
