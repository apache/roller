1. users are currently returned including their plain-text password. this is 
probably not the correct thing to do.

2. when users are posted, their plain text password is passed in the request.
should the password be encrypted in the client / decrypted by the server?

3. to avoid depending on another sandboxed component, auth utilities
are copied from atomprotocol. there is opportunity to re-use that code,
if it can be re-factored.
