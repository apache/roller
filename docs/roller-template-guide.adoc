== Introduction

If you know a little about HTML and CSS, then you’ll find that it’s easy
to customize the appearance, layout and content of your Roller-based
weblog. You can change the appearance of any of your weblog’s pages and
add as many new pages as you want. Any Roller user can do it through
Roller’s web-based interface and it’s all done with Roller’s simple and
easy-to-use template language. In this guide, we’ll tell you how. We’ll
start by explaining how Roller’s weblog template system works then we’ll
provide a reference to the objects and macros that you can use in your
templates.

NOTE: If you have only AUTHOR or LIMITED permissions within a weblog
then you won’t have access to the Design -> Theme or
Design -> Templates pages and you won’t be able to change or
customize your theme. You need to have ADMIN permission within a weblog
to be able to do the things described in this guide.

NOTE: By default, theme customization is disabled in Roller.
If you do have ADMIN permission in your weblog and you don’t see the
Design -> Templates page, perhaps your Roller site does not allow customization.
See your Roller Administrator about enabling custom themes on the Server Admin page.

== The Roller template system

Each Roller weblog is defined by a set of page templates, which you can
edit to customize the content, layout and appearance of your weblog.

=== Page templates

When you create a new Roller weblog you must pick a theme to define the
new weblog’s appearance and layout. A theme is just a small set of
templates, where each template contains HTML code, template language
expressions and macros. What’s a template? A template for an HTML web
page is simply an HTML web page with some Velocity code embedded inside.
For example, this is a valid Roller template, with one Velocity
expression:

----
<html>
  <body>
    My blog is named $model.weblog.name
</body>
</html>
----

The string "$model.weblog.name" is a template language expression and
when Roller displays the template, that expression will be replaced with
the name of the weblog.

Note that *$model* is something special. Roller makes a set of objects,
known as _models_, available to page templates. In the example above, we
see only the $model object, but here are others. You’ll learn more about
models in Section 5 and Section 6 provides a complete reference.

=== The Velocity template language

The simple template language that we use inside Roller page templates is
called Velocity. It’s designed to be simple and easy for even
non-programmers, but it’s also a simple programming language. You can
set variables, use if-else conditional logic and create loops.

For example, this Roller page template will list the categories
available in your weblog except for the one named Music:

----
<html>
  <body>
    My blog is named $model.weblog.name. These are my categories:<br>
    #foreach ($cat in $model.weblog.categories)
      #if ($cat.name != "Music")
        $cat.name<br>
      #end
    #end
  </body>
</html>
----

Velocity also supports the concepts of _macros_. A macro is essentially
a Velocity method call. We use them in Roller to generate HTML. For
example, as illustrated below, to display a bookmark folder you first
retrieve if from the weblog and second pass it to the
_#showBookmarkLinksList()_ macro to display it as an HTML _<ul>_ list.

----
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Blogroll</h2>
    #set($rootFolder = $model.weblog.getBookmarkFolder("/"))
    #showBookmarkLinksList($rootFolder)
  </body>
</html>
----

You’ll learn more about macros in Section 5 and Section 8 provides a
complete reference to the standard Roller macros. If you want more
information on Velocity, see http://wiki.apache.org/velocity/.

Now that we’ve covered the basic concepts of page templates and the
Velocity template language, let’s dig into the details of editing
templates.

== Editing and creating page templates

After you’ve used Roller *Design -> Themes* page to customize your
weblog theme, you can edit and create page templates through the
*Design -> Templates* page. We’ll show you how to do that, but first
you need to understand how the required pages, found in every theme,
work together to display a weblog.

Every theme is different, but all themes must have two required pages –
pages that you cannot rename or delete. These are the *Weblog* template,
which defines the main page of your blog, and the *_day* template, which
defines how each day’s worth of blog entries is displayed on your main
page. Some themes also have a required page named *_css* which defines
the CSS style code used by the weblog.

First, let’s look at a simple Weblog template.

=== The Weblog template

Below is a simple Weblog page that displays all of the data that weblog
typically contains including recent entries with paging to past entries,
category link, feed links, a calendar and feed auto-discovery. Check the
annotations for more detail.

Listing 1: a typical Weblog template
----
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
  <title>$model.weblog.name : $model.weblogPage.name</title> #1
  #showAutodiscoveryLinks($model.weblog) #2
  <style type="text/css">#includeTemplate($model.weblog "_css")</style> #3
</head>
<body>
  <table border="0" align="center" width="95%">
    <tr>
      <td class="entries" width="80%" valign="top">
        <h1>$model.weblog.name</h1> #4
        <p class="descrip">$model.weblog.description</p>
        #set($rootCategory = $model.weblog.getWeblogCategory("nil")) #5
        #showWeblogCategoryLinksList($rootCategory false false)<br>
        #set($pager = $model.getWeblogEntriesPager()) #6
        <div class="next-previous">
          #if ($model.results) #7
            #showWeblogSearchAgainForm($model.weblog)
            #showNextPrevSearchControl($pager)
          #else
            #showNextPrevEntriesControl($pager) #8
          #end
        </div>
        #showWeblogEntriesPager($pager) #9
        #if ($model.permalink) #10
          #showWeblogEntryComments($entry)
          #showWeblogEntryCommentForm($entry)
        #end
      </td>
      <td width="20%" valign="top">
        <h2>Calendar</h2>
        #showWeblogEntryCalendar($model.weblog "nil") #11
        <h2>Feeds</h2>
        #showAtomFeedsList($model.weblog) #12
        <h2>Search</h2>
        #showWeblogSearchForm($model.weblog false) #13
        <h2>Links</h2>
        #set($defaultFolder = $model.weblog.getBookmarkFolder("/")) #14
        #showBookmarkLinksList($defaultFolder)
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        #showPageMenu($model.weblog) #15
        #showAuthorMenu(true) #16
        <h2>Referrers</h2>
        #set($refs = $model.weblog.getTodaysReferrers()) #17
        #showReferrersList($refs 30 20)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</body>
</html>
----

The above template includes a good mix of Velocity expressions and
statements. There’s a lot going on, so let’s explain it in detail.
Here’s the point-by-point breakdown.


. *HTML title* For the HTML title we use the weblog’s name, a colon
and the name of the page template that is currently being displayed.
. *Auto-discovery links*
The __#showAutodiscoveryLinks() __macro adds
the HTML _<link>_ elements required for RSS and Atom feed auto-discovery
as well as RSD for weblog clients.
. *Include CSS styles* Here we use the include the theme’s *_css*
template directly in the page, right inside a pair of _<style>_ tags.
. *Display a page title* Here we use the weblog’s name again in an
_<h1>_ title.
. *Category links list* Display a list of weblog category links.
. *Get entries pager* Get the entries pager object so we can display
entries and a paging control.
. *Show search results control?* Show search results pager control if
search in progress
. **Else . . . ** Show normal entries pager control.
. *Show entries* Show current page’s worth of entries (or search
results). Calls on *_day* template to do the display of each day’s worth
of entries.
. *Show comments?* If we’re on a permalink page, then show comments
and comments form
. *Show the calendar* Show the standard weblog calendar.
. *Show feed links* Show links to all available Atom entry feeds, one
per category.
. *Search form* Show the weblog search form, false indicates no
category chooser.
. *Display blogroll* Display contents of the default (main) bookmark
folder.
. *Show page menu* Display navigation bar of pages available in
weblog.
. *Show author menu* Display author’s menu, only visible to authorized
users.
. *Display today’s referrers* Display today’s referrer URL with hit
counts.

Note in point #9 that the display of the weblog entries is controlled by
another template, the _day template. So next let’s take a look at that
_day template.

=== The _day template

A theme’s _day template is responsible for displaying one day’s worth of
weblog entries. Here’s a typical _day template, one that corresponds to
the above Weblog template.

Listing 2: a typical _day template

----
<div class="dayBox">
  <div class="dayTitle">
    $utils.formatDate($day, "EEEE MMM dd, yyyy") #1
  </div>
  #foreach($entry in $entries) #2
    <div class="entryBox">
      <p class="entryTitle">$entry.title</p> #3
      <p class="entryContent">
        #if($model.permalink) #4
          $entry.displayContent
        #else
          $entry.displayContent($url.entry($entry.anchor))
        #end
      </p>
      <p class="entryInfo">
        Posted at
        <a href="$url.entry($entry.anchor)"> #5
          $utils.formatDate($entry.pubTime, "hh:mma MMM dd, yyyy")</a>
        by $entry.creator.fullName in #6
        <span class="category">$entry.category.name</span> &nbsp;|&nbsp; #7
        #if
          ($utils.isUserAuthorizedToAuthor($entry.website)) #8
          <a href="$url.editEntry($entry.anchor)">Edit</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp;
        #end
        #if($entry.commentsStillAllowed || $entry.commentCount > 0) #9
          #set($link = "$url.comments($entry.anchor)" )
          <a href="$link" class="commentsLink">
          Comments[$entry.commentCount]</a>
        #end
      </p>
    </div>
  #end
</div>
----

And here’s a point-by-point description of the template language
expressions and statements found in the above day template:

. *Display day header.* For the day header, we display the current date
in a long format.
. *Loop through day’s entries.* Here we use a $foreach loop to iterate
through the $entries collection
. *Display entry title.* Display the entry title in a <div> so that it
can be easily styled.
. *Display entry content or summary.* If we’re on a permalink page, show
the entry’s content. Otherwise, show the summary if a summary is
available.
. *Display entry permalink.* Display permanent link to the entry.
. *Display entry author’s name.* Display the name of the author of the
entry.
. *Display entry category.* Display the name of the category associated
with the entry.
. *Show edit link.* If user is authorized, display link to edit the
entry.
. *Show comments link.* If comments are available or are still allowed,
display link to entry comments.

Now you’ve seen the required templates and you’ve seen most of the
commonly used macros in action, let’s discuss the mechanics of
customizing your theme.

=== Customizing your theme

When you start a Roller weblog and you pick a theme, your weblog uses a
_shared_ copy of that theme. The page templates that define your theme
are shared by all of the other users who have also picked that theme.
Using a shared theme is nice because, when your Roller site
administrator makes fixes and improvements to that shared theme, then
you’ll get those automatically. But you can’t customize a shared theme.
Before you can customize your theme, you’ve got to get your own copy of
the theme’s page templates like so:


1) *Go to the Design -> Theme page.*

Login to Roller and go to your
weblog’s *Design -> Theme* page and select the 'Custom Theme' option.

image::customize-theme-1.png[]


2) *Click on 'Update Theme' button*

If the you are using 'Custom Theme' option, you will see the following note:

_Since this is the first time using a custom theme, Roller will copy the templates from your existing Shared Theme so you can edit them._

Click on 'Update Theme' button to proceed.
When you do this, copies of the themes page templates will
be copied into your weblog so you can edit them.

image::customize-theme-2.png[]


3) *Customize your theme by editing and creating page templates.*
Go to the Design -> Templates page, edit your page templates and add new
ones as needed – as described in the next section.

And if you get tired of your customized theme, just use the
*Design -> Theme* page to switch back to a shared theme – or pick
another one to customize. Now let’s discuss editing and creating
templates.

=== Editing and creating page templates

Once you’ve got the page templates copied into your weblog, you can do
just about anything you want to your theme. You can use the
*Design -> Templates* page, shown below, to create a new page, delete
a page or choose a page to edit.

image::templates.png[]

Now might be a good time to describe the _page template properties_
since you can see them in the table above. The properties are name,
description. Let’s explain each:

* *Name*: Each template has a name, which you can display in your
templates. You can also use the _#includeTemplate()_ macro to include
the contents of one page in another, by referring to the template by
name.
* *Description*: You can enter an option description for each page for
display or just as a reminder to yourself as to the purpose of the page.

For new templates that you add, you’ll be able to edit all of those
properties using the *Design -> Template* page (shown
below).

image::template-edit.png[]

But the rules for _required pages_ are different. The weblog pages named
Weblog, _day and _css are considered to be required pages. You can
change the template code for those pages but you cannot edit the name,
link or any other properties.

Now that you know how to edit and create page templates, let’s discuss
how to use the models, objects and macros that Roller makes available to
template authors.

== Using models, objects and macros

Roller makes weblog data available to page templates in the form of
_models_ and _data_ __objects __and makes it easy for you to generate
the HTML for your weblog by providing _macros_. Let’s explain these new
terms.

* *Model objects*: Model objects provide access to data from Roller and
specifically from your Roller weblog. A model object returns data
objects or collections or data objects. In Section 7, we’ll describe each model, it’s
properties and methods.
* *Data objects*: Data objects each represent an item of data within
your Roller weblog, for example there is a _Weblog_ object that
represents your weblog, _WeblogEntry_ objects which represent individual
weblog entries and _Bookmark_ objects that represent items in your
blogroll. In Section 8, we’ll describe each data object, it’s properties
and methods.
* *Macros*. A macro is Velocity routine that generates HTML based on a
data object or a collection of data objects. In Section 9 we’ll describe
each of Roller’s build-in macros.

Let’s discuss how to access data via models and data objects.

=== Accessing data via models and objects

Models and data objects are objects and there are two ways to access
data from objects. One way is to access an objects properties. Another
is to call the object’s methods. Let’s talk about these two techniques.

==== Accessing object properties

To access an objects properties, you use a simple dot-notation. For
example, if you want to display the Roller version number property of
the *$config* model object, you do something like this in your page:

<p>**$config.rollerVersion**</p>

Or, if you’d like to save the Roller version number in a variable named
$version, you’d do this:

*#set( $version = $config.rollerVersion )*

And some properties are themselves objects, which in turn have their own
properties and methods. For example, you can get the Weblog object from
the $model object and from the weblog object you can display the
weblog’s name and description like so:

<p>**$model.weblog.name**</a>

<p>**$model.weblog.description**</a>

==== Calling object methods

Another way to access an object’s data is to call an objects’s methods.
Methods are different from properties because they require parameters.
You use the same simple dot-notation, but you must end the expression
with a list of parameters in parentheses. For example, if you’d like to
display an image from within your theme, you can use the $url model like
so:

<img='**$url.themeResource("basic", "background.gif")**'></a>

Argument one is the name of the theme and argument two is the name of a
file that exists in the theme’s directory. Note that a comma is used to
separate the arguments.

=== Calling macros

In page templates, you get data from objects and you use template code
to display that data as HTML. To help you along, Roller includes some
macros which can be used to generate commonly used HTML constructs on
your weblog. There are macros for displaying your weblog entries,
displaying your blogroll and displaying a comment form.

Calling a macro is a little different from calling a macro. A macro call
starts with a # pound-sign, followed by the macro name and the macro
parameters enclosed in parentheses. For example, you call the weblog
calendar macro like so:

*#showWeblogEntryCalendar($model.weblog "nil")*

Argument one is the weblog for the calendar and argument two is the
category, where "nil" indicates that no category is specified. Note
that the arguments for a macro are separated by a space and NOT a comma
as was the case for methods.

=== A word about pagers

There are many cases in a weblog when we want to display a large
collection of values and we want that collection to be page-able – that
is, we want a Next link to go to the next page of results and possibly a
Previous link to go to the previous page. So in Roller, we’ve introduced
the concept of a pager. A _pager_ is a special type of object that makes
it easy to display a page-able collection of items within a page
template. You can see a pager in action in Listing 1 above.

You probably won’t need to use a pager object directly, since the macros
do it for you. But if you do, here’s what a pager looks like:

* $pager.homeLink – URL of the first page of results
* $pager.homeName – Name to be displayed for that URL
* $pager.nextLink – URL of the next page of results
* $pager.nextName – Name to be displayed for that URL
* $pager.prevLink – URL of the previous page of results
* $pager.prevName – Name to be displayed for that URL
* $pager.items – Collection of data objects; the current page of results

There is also a WeblogEntryPager interface that provides some extra
methods for next-collection paging. The collection methods exist because
often, with weblog entries, we are paging through the entries that exist
within one time period, a month for example. In that case. the nextLink
point to the next page of results within that month and the
nextCollectionLink points to the next months entries.

* $pager.homeLink – URL of the first page of results
* $pager.homeName – Name to be displayed for that URL
* $pager.nextLink – URL of the next page of results
* $pager.nextName – Name to be displayed for that URL
* $pager.prevLink – URL of the previous page of results
* $pager.prevName – Name to be displayed for that URL
* $pager.nextCollectionLink – URL of next collection in sequence
* $pager.nextCollectionName – Name to be displayed for that URL
* $pager.prevCollectionLink – URL of previous collection in sequence
* $pager.prevCollectionName – Name to be displayed for that URL
* $pager.items – Collection of data objects; the current page of results

== Model Object Reference

This section covers the standard model objects available in all page
templates:

* $config – provides access to the Roller site configuration parameters
* $model – provides access to data for one specific weblog
* $url – for creating Roller URLs and URLs within one specific weblog
* $utils – utility methods needed within page templates

For each model, we’ll cover properties and methods.

=== $config

The $config model provides access to the Roller configuration data that
you’ll need in your weblog.

==== $config Properties

|===
|Property Name |Type |Description

|$config.analyticsOverrideAllowed
|Boolean
|True if individual bloggers are allowed to override the default tracking code (if any) provided by the blog administrator.

|===

==== $config Methods

The *$config* model also provides a set of methods for accessing
properties by name. Generally, you should be able to get the
configuration data you need from the properties above. You shouldn’t
need to call these methods, but just so you know:

* *boolean getBooleanProperty(String propertyName)* Returns the named
runtime property as a booean.
* *String getProperty(String propertyName)* Returns the named runtime
property as a String.
* *int getIntProperty(String propertyName)* Returns the named runtime
property as an integer.

=== $model

The **$model** object provides you with access to all of the data
objects that make up your weblog. You can get a pager object to access
your weblog entries, the weblog entry referenced by the request, the
category object referenced by the request and the weblog itself.

The diagram below show the objects you can get from the *$model* and the
collections of objects that you can get from those. See Section 7 for a
complete reference to the data objects and their properties.

And that’s it for the Roller macros. Before we move on to additional
models, let’s cover something you might want to do, but that doesn’t yet
have a macro – creating a tag cloud.

=== Displaying a Tag Cloud

We don’t yet include a Tag Cloud macro in Roller because it’s so easy to
create one yourself. Here’s what you do to display a tag cloud for your
weblog. First, if you have not already done so, customize your theme.
Next, you’ve got to get the tags you want to display from your weblog
object. For example, to get your most 30 most often used tags for all
time you’d do this:

`#set($mytags = $model.weblog.getPopularTags(-1, 30))`

Or if you want to only get tags used in the last 90 days you’d do this:

`#set($mytags = $model.weblog.getPopularTags(90, 30))`

Once you’ve got your tags, you can display them with a _foreach_ loop.
For example, here’s a loop that displays each tag as a link to your
weblog that displays only entries in that tag. It also gives each tag a
CSS class that indicates the intensity of the tag, which indicates on a
scale of zero to five how often-used the tag is.

----
#foreach ($tag in $mytags)
  <a class="tag s${tag.intensity}" href="$url.tag($tag.name)" title="$tag.count">
    $tag.name
  </a>
#end
----

Include that _#set_ statement and loop in your weblog template and
you’ll see a tag cloud, but it all the tags will be displayed in the
same size and font. If you’d like to vary the size of the tags based on
how often they are used, then you’ll need to add some CSS. Edit your CSS
template and add this to size often used tags larger than those less
often used:

----
.s1 {font-size:60%;}
.s2 {font-size:80%;}
.s3 {font-size:100%;}
.s4 {font-size:120%;}
.s5 {font-size:140%;}
----

== Additional models

There are some additional models that can be made available to Roller
weblogs by a site administrator. These are the
*$site* for accessing site-wide data,and the *planet* model for accessing Planet Roller data. Let’s start with the $site
model.

=== $site

The *$site* model provides access to site-wide data: aggregations of
webog entries from all weblogs, comments from all weblogs, lists of
users, lists of weblogs, etc. – in short, everything you need to build
an interesting community front page for Roller.

==== $site Objects

Site object

|===
|Name |Type |Description

|$site.commentCount
|Long
|Total number of comments in entire site

|$site.entryCount
|Long
|Total number of entries in entire site

|$site.userCount
|Long
|Total number of users in entire site

|$site.weblogCount
|Long
|Total number of weblogs in entire site
|===

For some SiteModel methods (e.g. hot-blogs, most commented, etc.) return
a special type of object use to expressing a count with a short name, a
long name and an internationalized type:

*StatCount object*

|===
|Name |Type |Description

|$stat.subjectNameLong
|WeblogEntry
|Long name of subject of statistic (e.g. name of a weblog)

|$stat.subjectNameShort
|String
|Short name of subject of statistic (e.g. handle of a weblog)

|$stat.count
|Integer
|Value of the statistic (i.e. number of hits)

|$stat.typeKey
|String
|I18N key for type of the statistic
|===

=== $planet

The *$planet* model makes Planet Roller data available to weblog pages.
It allows you to display the main aggregation (i.e. the one named
"external"), any custom group aggregation, a feed and ranked
subscriptions.

==== Configuring the planet model

The PlanetModel is not enabled by default in Roller, so before you can
use it in your weblogs you’ll need to enable it. To do that, you need to
define some properties in your Roller configuration and specifically, in
your _roller-custom.properties_ override file, which is explained in
STEP 8 and Appendix B of the Roller Installation Guide.

If you want to make the Planet model available in weblog pages then add
the Planet model to the list of models specified by the
_rendering.pageModels_ property by overriding the property in your
_roller-custom.properties_ file like so:

----
rendering.pageModels=\
org.apache.roller.ui.rendering.model.PageModel,\
org.apache.roller.ui.rendering.model.ConfigModel,\
org.apache.roller.ui.rendering.model.UtilitiesModel,\
org.apache.roller.ui.rendering.model.URLModel,\
org.apache.roller.ui.rendering.model.MessageModel,\
org.apache.roller.ui.rendering.model.CalendarModel,\
org.apache.roller.ui.rendering.model.MenuModel, \
org.apache.roller.ui.rendering.model.PlanetModel
----

That’s just a copy of the property setting from the default Roller
properties file, plus the Planet model (shown in bold). Actually,
depending on where want to use the Planet Model in Roller, you’ll need
to add the Planet model to a couple of different properties.

To make Planet model available in all blogs, you’ll want to add it to
these model list properties:

* rendering.pageModels: to make it available in blog pages.
* rendering.previewModels: to make it available when entries are
previewed in the blog editor

To make Planet model available in the front page blog only:

* rendering.siteModels: to make the model available in site-wide blogs

Now let’s discuss the objects available from the Planet model.

before: the PlanetSubscription object, which represents a feed
subscription, and PlanetEntry, which represents one entry from a feed.
