<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Roller is a Weblogger. Roller makes it easy for you to maintain a weblog,
even if you are have little or no knowledge of HTML. All you have to do is
go to a web site that is running the Roller software, sign up for an account
and bam you have a weblog. You can start posting right away. You will need
to know a little about HTML if you want to kick it up a notch by customizing
the layout of your Weblog and adding new pages to your Weblog website. More
on that later.</p>
<p>Please note that Roller is currently beta quality code – not necessarily
ready for prime time – there are probably a number of design flaws and an
even larger number of bugs. As always with software of all sorts, and especially
pre-release software such as this, use at your own risk.  If you find a flaw,
a bug, or something that you do not like please contribute back to the Roller
project be reporting that bug to the Roller development team's <a
 href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/roller/">JIRA
issue tracking system</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="getting_started"></a>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Signing up for a new account</h3>
<p class="western">To sign-up for a Roller account, go the the main Roller
page and click on the link that reads “register as a new user.” Enter your
login name, your real name, your desired password, your e-mail address, and
pick one of the predefined Weblog themes provided by Roller.  There is a
basic theme, which is a very good starting point for those who wish to build
their own themes.  And, there are three themes adapted from themes on <a
 href="http://www.blogskins.com">blogskins.com</a>: these are shown below.
 There is also a new XHTML/CSS based theme called x2 that was contributed
by <a href="http://www.raibledesigns.com/">Matt Raible</a>.<br>

<p class="western">After your account is created you will be returned to
the main Roller page. You will see that your name has been added to the list
of Roller users displayed on the main page. If you click on your name in
this list, you will be taken to your Weblog page.</p>
<h3>Your initial website</h3>
<p class="western">Your initial website will include just one webpage that
is visible to your readers and that is named "Weblog". This page will include
a navigation bar, a weblog category chooser, a weblog calendar, some links
and a weblog area where your posts will appear. The screenshot below shows
what your page will look like if you chose the Roller basic theme:</p>
<p class="western" align="center">Figure 1: your initial Weblog page, assuming
you chose the basic theme</p>
<p class="western" align="center">  <a href="weblog.gif"><img
 src="weblog_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="276"></a><br clear="left">
</p>
<h3>Logging in</h3>
<p class="western">From your Weblog page or from the main Roller page, click
the Login link. Enter your username and password, click submit, and you will
be taken to your Weblob page again. But this time, you will see some new
Links on the page: Weblog:Edit, Weblog:Categories, Weblog:Flush-Cache, Bookmarks,
Newsfeeds, and Website. These links lead you to pages for editing your Weblog,
categories, bookmarks (AKA links), newsfeeds, and the actual pages that make
up your website. First, lets talk about how to edit your Weblog.</p>
<h2><a name="editing_your_weblog"></a>Editing your Weblog</h2>
    
<h3>Adding a new entry</h3>
<p>Editing your Weblog means adding new Weblog entries to be enjoyed by your
readers and editing older Weblog entries to correct mistakes, clarify points,
or to censor those drunken ramblings you entered last night.</p>
<p>To add a new Weblog entry you simply go to the Edit-Weblog page, enter
an optional title, enter the Weblog entry, choose a Weblog category. and
hit the Submit button. As soon as you do that, your Weblog entry is posted
to your Weblog for the world to see.  <br>
</p>
<p>Generally, you will not need to use the Flush Cache link on the Weblog:Edit
page, unless you are using SQL to muck about in the Roller database and you
want to force the cache to reset itself.  Normally, as you edit weblog entries,
bookmarks, and other things Roller should automatically reset it's cache
as needed.<br>
</p>
<p align="center">Figure 2: the Edit-Weblog page<br>
<br>
</p>
<div align="center"><a href="edit-weblog.gif"><img
 src="edit-weblog_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="421"></a><br
 clear="left">
</div>

<span style="color: red;">We need a new screenshot here</span>
<h3>Publishing an entry</h3>
<p>The buttons "Post to Weblog" and "Save as Draft" control whether or not your weblog entry is
visible on your weblog's main page. If you click "Post to Weblog", then your entry
is visible to your readers.  If you click "Save as Draft", then your entry is
private.</p>
<p>The text field marked "Pub Time" controls the publish time your your entry.
 Changing the publish time may change the order of weblog entries displayed
on your weblog.  When you enter a new publish time, you must use the format
<span style="font-weight: bold;">dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss</span></p>

<h3>Editing an old entry</h3>
<p>You can edit or remove an old Weblog entry by clicking on the Edit or Remove
links in the Recent Weblog Entries part of the page. If the Weblog entry that
you want to edit is not so recent and is not shown in the Recent Weblog Entries
list, then you can use the Weblog Entry Archive calendar to find that old
entry.</p>

<span style="color: red;">Need a SpellCheck screenshot here</span>
<h3>SpellChecking an entry</h3>
<p>If you would like to Spellcheck your entry, click the "Spell Check" button.
This will take you to another page which displays "suspect" words in drop-downs.
The Spellchecking software doesn't understand HTML, so any tags used will likely
be marked as suspect.  To correct any errors, select the proper spelling from
the appropriate drop-down.  If you'd rather not use the drop-downs, you can edit 
the text directly in the textbox provided.</p>

<h3>Posting using a Blogger API client</h3>
<p>You can use any Blogger API client to post and edit Roller weblog entries.
 Before you can do this, you must go to the Roller Website:Settings menu
and check the box that reads Enable Blogger API for your weblog.  You should
also pick a category for posts made through the Blogger API.  Be aware that
one shortcoming of Blogger API based blogging clients titles. The Blogger
API does not support weblog entry titles.</p>
<p>Once you have enabled Blogger API support for your weblog, you can use
any Blogger API client to post and edit your Roller weblog. For example,
you could use the <a href="http://wbloggar.com">w:bloggar</a>client.  Below
is a screenshot of the w:bloggar client.  As you can see, you need to configure
w:bloggar by entering your host name, port number, and the path /roller/xmlrpc
into the w:bloggar Account Connection dialog-box.  You also need to enter
your Roller username and password in to the w:bloggar login dialog.<br>

 width="300" height="289" border="0"></a><br>
</div>
<br>
<h3>Flushing the cache</h3>
The flush-cache button allows you to flush the Roller page cache.  The page
cache is a performance feature that allows Roller to serve up pages faster
and to minimize database access.  Normally, the cache is flushed when you
edit a weblog entry, add a new page template, or do just about any other operation.
 So, under normal conditions you should not need to flush the cache. <br>
<h3>Referer rankings</h3>
The referer rankings page shows the hits that are coming in from other websites
and weblogs that have links to your weblog and to specific entries in your
weblog.  By looking at your referer logs, you can get an idea of who is reading
and commenting on your weblog.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="editing_bookmarks"></a>Editing your bookmark collection</h2>
<h3>Adding new book<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>mark
folders</h3>
<p>You probably already have a web bookmark collection stored in your web
browser, so why do you need to enter bookmarks into Roller. Well, most Weblog
authors like to include links to their favorite websites and to their favorite
Weblogs right on their Weblog page. Roller's bookmark feature makes it easy
for you to do this too.</p>
<p>Bookmarks are organized in to named folders. You can define any number
of folders and each of these folders can hold any number of bookmarks. There
is only one level of folders, so you cannot have a folder that contains other
folders. </p>
<p>Your initial website contains two bookmark folders: one named “Blogrolling”
that contains Weblogging related links and one named “News” that contains
links to well known news sources. If you look at Figure 1 again, you can
see that these two folder are displayed on the left side of the Weblog page.
You can use Roller's bookmark management features to rename these folders
if you wish, or you can delete them add add folders of your own choosing.</p>
<p align="center">Figure 3: the Edit-Bookmark Folders page<br>
<br>
</p>
<div align="center"><a href="edit-bookmark.gif"><img
 src="edit-bookmark_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="355"></a><br
 clear="left">
</div>
<h3>Adding bookmarks to folders</h3>
<p>Once you have defined one or more bookmark folders, you can start adding
bookmarks to those folders. From the Edit-Bookmark Folders page, click the
Edit link for the Folder you wish to edit. You will be taken to the Edit-Bookmark
Folder page for that folder. From there you can edit the name of the folder
and you can add and remove bookmarks in that folder.</p>
<p align="center">Figure 4: the Edit-Bookmark Folder page</p>
<p align="center"><a href="edit-folder.gif"><img src="edit-folder_.jpg"
 alt="" width="300" height="355"></a><br>
</p>
<h3>Editing a bookmark</h3>
<p>After you use the Edit-Bookmark Folder to add a bookmark, you can edit
the Bookmark itself. To edit a bookmark, click on the Edit link in the Edit-Bookmark
Folder page. That will take you to the Edit-Bookmark page and from there
you can change the name, description and display priority of the bookmark
you have chosen to edit. You can also move the bookmark to another folder
by changing the Bookmark Folder combo-box.</p>

 clear="left">
</div>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3>Importing Bookmarks in OPML format</h3>
Roller makes it easy to import bookmarks and build your blogroll by importing
bookmarks in OPML format.  XBEL might be a better bookmarks format, but OPML
is more popular in the world of weblogs.  To import bookmarks via OPML, follow
these steps:<br>
  
<ol>
  <li>download bookmarks in OPML format from a site such as Scripting.COM
and save them as a file on your hard disk.</li>
  <li>Login to Roller and choose the Bookmarks:Import menu option.</li>
  <li>Use the file-upload capability to upload the OPML file into Roller.
 The bookmarks will be imported into a folder called "unfiled".  You can
use Roller to organize the bookmarks as you wish. </li>
</ol>
<p><br>
</p>
<h2><a name="editing_newsfeeds"></a>Editing your newsfeed collection</h2>
<h3>Adding and deleting newsfeeds</h3>
<p>A newsfeed is a list of news stories and a short desciption of each story
that is automically retrieved from some remote website. Newsfeeds are delivered
in a format known as Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary or just
RSS.</p>
<p>Roller allows you to include newsfeeds on your Weblog page or on a separate
page that you create as part of your Weblog's website. Your initial website
will include three newsfeeds, but none of these newsfeeds are displayed on
your Weblog page. You can use one of the macros that we will discuss later
to display your newsfeeds.</p>
<p>Before you include a newsfeed on your website, you should probaby make
sure that doing so is OK with the provider of the newsfeed. Some providers
might frown upon this and by frown I mean that they might sick a pack of
rabid lawyers on your ass. Anyhow, use your own judgement here – I am not
a lawyer and I am not responsible for any of your current or future legal
troubles.</p>
<p>To add a newsfeed you need a URL to the providers RSS feed. This URL usually
ends with the letters “.xml”. Enter the name that you would like to use for
the newsfeed, enter the URL and hit enter to add the newsfeed.</p>
<h2><a name="customizing_your_pages"></a>Customizing your website</h2>
<h3>Website settings</h3>
The website settings form allows you to set the following properties for your
weblog website:<br>
<ul>
  <li>    
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Website title</span> - The title of
your website may include HTML, but the HTML will be stripped out in your RSS
feed. You can access your title in a page template with the expression  
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">$macros.website.title</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Website description</span> - The description
of your website may include HTML, but the HTML will be stripped out in your
RSS feed. You can access your description in a page template with the expression
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">$macros.website.description</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Homepage page</span> - Choose a page
template to be used as your websites main page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Day template page</span> - Choose
a page template to be used to display weblog entries via the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">$macros.showWeblogEntries()</span> macro.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weblog editor page</span> - Choose
either the plain old text editor (editor-text.jsp), the Ekit editor applet
(editor-ekit.jsp), or the IE only Mitchell editor (editor-dhtml.jsp).</p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enable Blogger API </span>- Set to
true to enable weblogging via the Blogger API.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Category for Blogger API posts</span>
- Choose the category for incoming posts made via the blogger API.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Website pages</h3>
<p>Your Weblog page is defined by a page template. A template is a file with
some special "macros" that indicate where Roller is supposed to put your
Weblog, Weblog Calendar, and other dynamically created content. A templage
can be an HTML file, an HTML fragment, a CSS page, or just about anything
else you can enter into Roller as text.</p>
<p>You initial Roller website has three page template, only one of which
is visible to users. The pages are named Weblog, _DayTemplate and _css.</p>
<ul>
  <li>                             
    <p>The Weblog page is the visible page, it is the HTML template that
defines your Weblog. It is a mix of HTML and Roller macros that render the
dynamic parts of the page like the Weblog Calendar and the actual Weblog
entries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>                             
    <p>The _DayTemplate page is the HTML template that defines the entries
for each day are formatted in your Weblog page. This is essentially an HTML
fragment with some Roller macros for rendering the day's Weblog entries,
title, date, and other items.</p>
  </li>
  <li>                             
    <p>The _css page is a CSS style-sheet information that is included (using
a macro) on your Weblog page.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You can define as many pages as you would like. You must specify which
page is to be your Default Page, that is, the page that your readers first
see when they visit your website. You must also specify which page is your
Weblog day template.</p>
<p>Note that any page whose name begins with the underbar “_” character will
not be visible to your readers. That is why the _DayTemplate and _css pages
start with underbars, they are used internally and are not meant for public
consumption.</p>
<p align="center">Figure 6: the Edit-Website page</p>
<p align="center"><a
 href="edit-website.gif"><img
 src="edit-website_.jpg"
 alt="" width="300" height="355"></a><br>
</p>
<p>If you click on one of the Current Pages in the Edit-Website page, you
will be directed to the Edit-Page page so that you can edit that page. You
can put anything on a page, but typically you will put HTML with some Roller
macros mixed in. Next you will read about the various Roller macros that
are available for your use.</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows the Weblog page being edited in the Edit-Page
page.</p>
<p align="center">Figure 7: the Edit-Page page</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a
 href="edit-page.gif"><img
 src="edit-page_.jpg"
 alt="" width="300" height="346"></a><br>
</div><br>

<h3>Weblog Themes</h3>
<p>Besides editing your pages directly, you can Preview the other templates and
modifications to your weblog page.  <font color="red">NOTE: this feature is only good for editing
the default page, which must be your weblog page if you want to preview other
templates.</font>  On the "Change your Weblog Template" page you may select another
theme to preview, or edit the template directly.  
<ul>
<li>Clicking the "Preview" button
will load a page where you will be able to see any changes or the theme you
selected.</li>
<li>Clicking "Save" saves those changes, or the new theme, to your Weblog page:
this change cannot be 'undone'.  You might want to make a backup copy of your
Weblog page before you begin working on any changes.</li>
<li>Clicking "Cancel" clears any changes you haven't
saved and sends you to the Website Settings page.</li>
</ul>
On the Preview page, if you 
click edit you will be sent back to the Change your Weblog Template page.  If
you had selected a Theme it will be selected on this page and its template displayed
in the edit box.  To continue editing this template, select Custom from the Theme
list, make any changes you desire and click Preview.</p>

<h3>Website files</h3>
Roller now includes a file-upload feature that allows you to upload images
and other file for use in your weblog templates.  Here are the steps to upload
and image to Roller and to use it in a weblog template:  
<ol>
  <li>Use the Weblog:File menu option to upload your image file</li>
  <li>Use the Weblog:Pages menu to edit one of your templates.  Place the
HTML IMG tag where you want the image to appear and use $macros.showResourcePath()
directive to build the URL for the image.  For example, if your image was
called leo.gif you might insert an IMG tag like this: &lt;img src="$macros.showResourcePath()/leo.gif"
alt="one happy baby" /&gt;</li>
</ol>
<h3>User settings</h3>
You can use the User Settings form to set your Full Name, Password, and Email
address.
<h3>Export</h3>
Your Roller administrator should be using some sort of database utility to
back up the Roller database on a regular basis. If you are worried that backups
are not being done and you want to store a copy of your Roller data on your
personal computer, you can use Roller's new export capability to export your
weblog data in Roller's XML format.  Currently, there is no import facility
for Roller XML so in the case of data-loss you will need your administrator's
help to recreate your user.<br>
<h3>Admin</h3>
<h3></h3>
The admin screen is only available to Roller administrators.  It allows an
administrator to delete a user account from Roller.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="macros_for_page"></a>Macros intended for use on any page template</h2>
<p>Macros tell Roller where to place the dynamic parts of your web pages.
Macros use <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/index.html">Velocity</a> expressions and
custom JSP tag libraries. For more information on Velocity,
visit the Velocity web site and read the Velocity 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/user-guide.html">User's Guide</a>. Note that
we use the term macro loosely, but it does have a specific meaning in Velocity.
What we call a macro is really a Velocity expression.  To learn more about JSP
and tag libraries, visit Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">JSP site</a>.<br>

methods.  The macros object is actually a Java object.  To see the methods
that are available to you via the <span style="font-weight: bold;">$macros</span>
