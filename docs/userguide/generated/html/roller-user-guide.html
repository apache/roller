		<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">1 - Introduction</H1>
		<P CLASS="western">This user guide describes how to use Roller, a
		web application that can support a single user weblog, thousands of
		weblogs and/or group weblogs. You'll learn how to register as a new
		user, create weblogs, edit and post weblog entries and manage your
		weblog. You'll also learn how to customize your weblog's <I>blogroll</I>,
		a list of links to your favorite web sites,and how to change the
		look-and-feel or <I>theme</I> of your weblog.</P>
		<P CLASS="western">A word about terminology is necessary because
		the word weblog is both a noun and a verb. In this guide we use the
		words weblog and weblog entry as follows: 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Weblog</I>: a
			weblog or blog is an online journal written by one or more
			authors. In Roller a weblog consists of weblog entries, weblog
			categories, favorite bookmarks and settings that define the
			appearance and behavior of the weblog. 
			</P>
			<LI><P CLASS="western"><I>Weblog entry</I>: a weblog entry is an

		<P CLASS="western">We'll start by explaining how to get started

		<H2>2.1 - Getting started with a new Roller installation</H2>
		<P CLASS="western">If you've just installed a new Roller server,
		make sure that you create the first user yourself. Roller grants
		global admin permission to the very first user that is created.
		Later, you can use that admin user to grant global admin permission

		<P CLASS="western">Roller now includes support for <I>podcasting</I>,
		a way to distribute files through your weblog's newsfeed.
		Typically, folks use Podcasting to distribute audio files, but the
		technique can be used to distribute any type of file. Specialized
		Podcast client software (such as <A HREF="http://ipodderx.com/">iPodderX</A><IMG SRC="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/wiki/images/out.png" NAME="graphics10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 BORDER=0>)
		downloads the audio files that are referenced in your newsfeed and

		weblog pings</H1>
		<P CLASS="western">Weblog update pings provide a means for you to
		notify aggregation and indexing sites, (for example Weblogs.com,
		Technorati and javablogs.com) that your weblog has changed so that
		they will pick up your latest content from your RSS feed. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">Roller supports conventional XML-RPC weblog
		update ping mechanism used by many sites for such notifications. 
		</P>
		<H2>7.1 - Registering with an Aggregator</H2>
		<P CLASS="western">Generally speaking, aggregation sites first
		require you to register your weblog with their site. During this
		registration process you normally provide both the HTTP URL and the
		RSS feed URL for your weblog. This is important because the ping
		message conveys only the normal HTTP URL of your site, and the site
		will use that to lookup the registered RSS feed URL to fetch from. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">Aggegation sites that accept ping notifications
		generally publish the ping URL to use to ping their site on their
		(human-readable) web site. Once you have registered your site with
		an aggregator, you can set up your weblog to deliver pings to that
		site. 
		</P>
		<H2>7.2 - Ping Targets, Common and Custom</H2>
		<P CLASS="western">You can set up the Roller server to ping sites
		of your choice automatically whenever you post published updates to
		your weblog. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">Roller uses the term <B>ping target</B> to refer
		to a site, such as an aggregator, that accepts weblog update ping
		notifications. A ping target is configured with a (display) name
		and the ping URL needed to reach the site. Before you can send a
		ping to a site, you must configure a ping target in Roller for the
		site. Roller supports the configuration of two types of ping
		targets: 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><DT CLASS="western"><B>common ping targets<BR></B>These are

			</DT><LI><DT CLASS="western">
			<B>custom ping targets<BR></B>These are ping targets that are

		<H2>7.3 - Setting up Automated Pings</H2>

		ping targets to make sure that the URL you have entered is working
		properly. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">You do not need to enable automatic pinging in
		order to send manual pings. You can send a manual ping whether or
		not you have enabled automatic pinging for that target. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">You can use manual pings if you ping a site very
		rarely, or if you are feeling a bit impatient, and you don't want
		to wait for the next queue processing interval. 
		</P>
		<H2>7.5 - Creating and Editing Custom Ping Targets</H2>
		<P CLASS="western">You should find that most popular ping targets
		are listed among the common ping targets and you can ping these
		without needing to create a new custom one. If you don't find a
		common target listed for the site you wish to ping, you have two
		options. You can request that your administrator add a new common
		ping target (directions in <A HREF="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=UserGuide_2.x#ref-UserGuide_2.x-21">[21]</A>);
		most likely, your friendly Roller administrator will be happy to
		add new common ping targets for aggregator sites that many other
		users will also be interested in using. Alternatively, you can add
		your own custom ping target using the <B>Weblog:Custom Ping Targets</B>
		page. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in"><I><B>Note:</B>
		Custom ping targets are a feature that the administrator can
		disable. If you do not see <B>Weblog:Custom Ping Targets</B> menu
		item, or any heading for Custom Ping Targets on the <B>Weblog:Pings</B>
		page, then an administrator has disabled it, and you will need to
		contact an administrator to get a new common ping target added.</I>
				</P>
		<P CLASS="western">Before adding a custom ping target, you must
		determine the proper ping URL for the site that you wish to ping.
		You must get this information from the aggregator's web site or
		from another knowledgeable source. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">It can be hard to find the aggregator's
		documentation telling you the specific ping URL to use to notify
		their site. Commonly aggregators list this on their web site under
		a topic providing help about registering your feed, or under a
		topic providing information for developers. Keep in mind that some
		aggregators only use periodic polling and do not accept ping
		notifications at all. If you can't find any information about
		pinging on the aggregator's web site, the site may not support
		pinging. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">Once you have found the proper ping URL, you can
		add your custom target using the <B>Weblog:Custom Ping Targets</B>
		page, which looks something like the following screen-shot.

		with an Aggregator</H2>
		<P CLASS="western">When you register with an aggregator, you will
		usually need to provide two pieces of information as part of the
		registration, your blog's base (HTML) url and your RSS feed (XML)
		URL. Make sure to read the aggregator's documentation and help on
		registering. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">For Roller weblogs, you get your weblog's base
		URL by viewing your weblog and taking the URL to the point just
		following your weblog's handle. (In other words it should end with
		<TT>page</TT>/<I>handlenamehere</I>). 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">The RSS feed URL for your whole feed can be
		obtained by substituting <TT>page</TT> in your weblog's URL with
		<TT>RSS</TT>. Most browsers will display this link in the status
		bar when you place your mouse over RSS badge (the little orange XML
		box) on your weblog page. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">You also have category-specific feeds, which are
		useful for registering with topical aggregators like <B>java.blogs</B>.
		To get a category-specific feed URL, just append
		<TT>?catname=</TT><I>/category/path</I> where <I>/category/path</I>
		is the full path of the category. The &quot;basic&quot; theme has
		some category RSS feeds just below the RSS badge in the right-hand
		vertical bar. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">Some aggregators can also scrape (read and parse
		the HTML of your weblog) to discover the feed URL automatically
		when provided with the HTML URL. The default Roller theme template
		pages include hints in the form of tags that many sites can use to
		determine the feed URL automatically.

				<P CLASS="western">You can create and edit common ping in the

				but keep in mind that common ping targets are shared amongst all
				users, and that your changes affect all users using the ping
				target. 
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western">Administrators should make sure to test new
				common ping targets after creating them. 
				</P>
				<H2>9.2 - How Roller Processes Weblog Update Pings</H2>
				<P CLASS="western">Roller processes weblog update pings in the
				background. When a user updates his or her weblog, Roller
				automatically queues any required automated pings on a queue.
				Roller only keeps one ping queue entry for a given user weblog
				and ping target. Subsequent updates to a weblog occurring before
				the ping is processed will not cause additional pings to be
				queued. 
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western">Roller makes a full pass through the ping
				queue at regular intervals. (Configuration of this interval is
				discussed below) In each pass, Roller will attempt to send every
				queued ping request once. If any send fails (and provided the
				failure appears to be a transient one), the ping request will be
				re-queued, until the ping succeeds or a configured number of
				attempts has been made. Note that when a ping request fails and
				is re-queued, it is processed again only on subsequent ping
				passes. If the number of attempts to reach a given ping target
				reaches the maximum without succeeding, then an error message is
				logged and the ping request is dropped. 
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western">There is currently no mechanism for alerting
				users of failing ping targets (though we plan some improvements
				in subsequent releases to provide condition information on the
				weblog <B>Preferences-&gt;Pings</B> page, as well as a failure
				policy to deactivate persistently failing ping targets). 
				</P>
				<H2>9.3 - Configuration Properties Controlling Ping Processing</H2>
				<P CLASS="western">These properties control processing of the
				ping queue. They are configured in the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier New">roller.properties</FONT></TT><FONT FACE="Courier New">
				</FONT>file. 
				</P>
				<DL>
					<DD CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0.2in">
					<FONT SIZE=3><B>pings.queueProcessingIntervalMins </B>The
					interval in minutes between ping queue processing runs. This
					must be a value in the range 0 to 120. The default value is 5
					minutes. We think the default value should work for most sites,
					and is tolerable for most users. The number of users publishing
					or updating entries in a given interval determines the length of
					the queue, and Roller requires enough time in an interval to
					process the queue once. We think that for all but the largest
					and most active sites, it can probably be lowered as low as 1
					minute if desired. <B>IMPORTANT</B>: The value 0 (zero) has a
					special meaning. If the processing interval is set to 0, ping
					queue processing is disabled on the server. This can be used to
					exclude all but one host from sending pings in a clustered
					environment where multiple Roller servers are sharing one
					database schema. <B>Make sure to retain one host in the cluster
					that does process the ping queue!</B> If multiple hosts in a
					cluster process the ping queue, you may send duplicate pings and
					failing ping requests may drop out of the queue sooner than the
					expected maximum (configured by the next parameter). If no hosts
					in a cluster process the ping queue, auto ping requests will
					accumulate in the queue and this will eventually cause the
					database to run out of space, so don't try to use this as a way
					to disable ping features. You can use the properties described
					in the following sections to disable ping features. </FONT>

					<FONT SIZE=3><B>pings.maxPingAttempts </B>The maximum number of

					value is 3. We think this value is fine for most sites. </FONT>
					</DD></DL>
				<H2>
				9.4 - Suspending all ping processing</H2>
				<P CLASS="western">Administrators can suspend all ping processing
				at runtime by checking the <B>Suspend ping processing?</B>
				checkbox under the <B>Site Settings</B> heading on the <B>Global
				Admin-&gt;Configuration</B> page and saving that form. 
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western">When this checkbox is set, all ping processing
				is suspended. New automatic ping requests are not added to the
				queue, and existing entries on the queue are not processed.
				Manual pings are not sent either; they result in a message
				telling the user that ping processing has been suspended.
				Suspending ping processing is appropriate to temporarily stop all
				ping processing if problems are encountered. 
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western">Unchecking the checkbox and saving allows
				normal ping processing to resume. Note, however, that autopings
				for weblogs that are updated while ping processing is suspended
				will never be queued and hence never sent, but pings queued
				before the suspension are sent once the suspension is lifted. 
				</P>
				<H2>9.5 - Controlling and disabling ping usage</H2>
				<P CLASS="western">Since use of a ping target causes an outbound
				network connection to the ping site, some administrators may not
				want to allow users to create their own custom ping targets. It
				is possible to enable or disable the use of custom ping targets
				across the whole site and also to disable all ping usage. The
				following two properties are used to control this.

				10 - Planet Roller administration 
				</H1>
				<P CLASS="western">Roller includes an aggregator known as Planet
				Roller, which makes it possible for your to aggregate together
				weblogs from a Roller server with weblogs that are hosted
				elsewhere. You can create multiple aggregation groups each with
				its own set of feeds, you can display aggregation groups on your
				weblog pages and Roller provides an RSS feed for each group you
				create.</P>
				<P CLASS="western">This section describes how to setup, configure
				and run the Planet Roller aggregator.</P>
				<H2>10.1 - Setting up the Planet aggregator</H2>
				<P CLASS="western">Before you can configure and use the Planet
				aggregator, you must set it up. Here are the steps:</P>
				<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><B>STEP1: Enable the Planet
				aggregator </B></FONT>
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western">Set  <FONT FACE="Courier New">planet.aggregator.enabled=true</FONT>
				in your Roller properties override file.</P>
				<P CLASS="western">Enter a valid cache directory in the
				<FONT FACE="Courier New">planet.aggregator.cache.dir</FONT>
				property of your Roller properties override file. Make sure the
				cache directory exists and is writable by the user who owns the
				Roller process.</P>
				<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><B>STEP 2: Obtain a Technorati
				license (optional)</B></FONT></P>
				<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you'd like to
				display Technorati rankings for the weblogs in Planet Roller,
				you'll need a Technorati key. You can get an API key
				free-of-charge from the Technorati Developer Center. Place the
				API key in a file (with no whitespace) named <FONT FACE="Courier New">technorati.license</FONT>
				and place that license in the <FONT FACE="Courier New">WEB-INF/classes</FONT>
				directory of your Roller install.</P>
				<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><B>STEP 3: Setup the
				refresh-entries task</B></FONT></P>
				<P CLASS="western">The RefreshEntriesTask is responsible for
				updating each of the blogs in the Planet aggregator. You should
				set it up to run every hour. There are two ways to do this. You
				can add it to the list of hourly tasks run by Roller's built-in
				scheduler by adding the following to your Roller properties
				override file:</P>
				<P CLASS="western">   <FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>#
				Comma separated list of task classnames to be executed hourly</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P CLASS="western">  
				<FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>tasks.hourly=org.apache.roller.ui.core.tasks.RefreshEntriesTask</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P CLASS="western">However, some folks have found that the
				RefreshEntriesTask can works best when run outside of Roller. If
				you want to do that instead, you can use cron on UNIX or Windows
				Task scheduler to run the task. For UNIX users, use the
				rollertask.sh script which can be found in the Roller install
				directory under docs/examples. You'll have to modify it to set
				your paths and your JDBC driver jar.</P>
				<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><B>STEP 4: Setup the
				sync-websites task</B></FONT></P>
				<P CLASS="western">The SyncWebsitesTask ensures that every blog
				in the Roller system is included in the Planet aggregator. It is
				intended to run every night. Every time that it runs, it adds all
				new blogs and removes all blogs that no longer exist. If you have
				a valid technorati.license file your classpath, it will also rank
				the blogs in the system using the Techorati system. To setup
				sync-websites, add the following to your Roller propeties
				override file.</P>
				<P CLASS="western">   <FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>#
				Daily Planet task: syncs weblog list with Roller, refreshes
				Technorati stats</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P CLASS="western">  
				<FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>tasks.daily=org.apache.roller.ui.core.tasks.SyncWebsitesTask</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P CLASS="western">As with the refresh-entries tasks, some have
				found that sync-websites runs best outside of Roller. You can run
				it from cron or Windows Task Scheduler too. And again, UNIX users
				can use <FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><FONT FACE="Courier New">rollertask.sh</FONT></FONT>
				to do this.</P>
