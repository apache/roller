!!!Make your First Weblog Post

After you login, you will be presented with the Weblog:Edit page, shown below, which is just one part of the Roller Editor UI. The Weblog:Edit page is shown below. To make a weblog post enter a title in the Title field (titles are nice, but optional), enter your post in the Content field, and pick a category combo-box. Don't enter anything in for the Publication Time, Roller will fill that in for you. You can use any sort of HTML markup that you want in your post, but make sure you close all of your HTML tags.

When you are happy with your post, you can click the __Post to Weblog__ button to post it to your weblog or the __Save as Draft__ button to save it as a private post for later editing. Optionally, you may choose to click the __Spell Check__ button to check and correct spelling errors in your post.
