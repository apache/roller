# planet.properties
#
# This file is for meant for Roller deployment properties
# Any properties that don't change at runtime are defined here
#
# You can override the values in this file in a couple ways ..
#   1. define a planet-custom.properties file and place it somewhere
#       at the root of one of your classpath locations.
#       for example:
#           $TOMCAT_HOME/common/classes
#           $PLANET_LOCATION/WEB-INF/classes
#
#   2. specify a custom properties file via jvm option
#       example:
#           planet.custom.config=/path/to/properties/file
#
#   **NOTE: if you run multiple instances of roller on the same server
#           then you should beware of the fact that the override options above
#           may affect *all* of you running instances.  if you want to do
#           custom overrides for each instance then you must do it by
#           placing a planet-custom.properties file at WEB-INF/classes/ in
#           each of you planet installations.
#
# properties in this file are accessed like this ...
#    PlanetConfig.getProperty("propname");

# You MUST override and set these three properties correctly:
planet.aggregator.cache.dir=/var/planet/cache
planet.aggregator.output.dir=/usr/local/planet/webapp
planet.aggregator.template.dir=/usr/local/planet/webapp/WEB-INF/templates

# Name of control template (in template dir) to be used
planet.aggregator.mainPage=control.vm

# JDBC configuration. Don't override these in the planet-custom.properties file
# you use with the Planet webapp, but for the standalone tasks (e.g. refresh 
# entries) you'll need to override these properties. Do it in a separate 
# planet-custom.properties file.
