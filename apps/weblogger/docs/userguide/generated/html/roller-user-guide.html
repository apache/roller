<P CLASS="western">This user guide describes how to use Roller, a web
application that can support a single user weblog, thousands of
weblogs and/or group weblogs. You'll learn how to register as a new
user, create weblogs, edit and post weblog entries and manage your
weblog. You'll also learn how to customize your weblog's <I>blogroll</I>,
a list of links to your favorite web sites,and how to change the
look-and-feel or <I>theme</I> of your weblog.</P>
<P CLASS="western">A word about terminology is necessary because the
word weblog is both a noun and a verb. In this guide we use the words
weblog and weblog entry as follows:

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Weblog</I>: a
	weblog or blog is an online journal written by one or more authors.

	and it cannot be changed later.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Category</B> &ndash; You can pick one
	category for your weblog entry. Categories are for folks who want to
	organized the entries in their weblog into a small-set of fixed and

	editor that you can use to edit the raw HTML markup of your weblog
	entries. Don't use this unless you know HTML.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Summary</B> &ndash; (optional) If you
	wish, you can enter a short summary of your weblog post. If you do

most likely, your friendly Roller administrator will be happy to add
new common ping targets for aggregator sites that many other users

documentation telling you the specific ping URL to use to notify
their site. Commonly aggregators list this on their web site under a

aggregators only use periodic polling and do not accept ping
notifications at all. If you can't find any information about pinging
on the aggregator's web site, the site may not support pinging.

	</OL>
</OL>
<P CLASS="western">Roller processes weblog update pings in the
background. When a user updates his or her weblog, Roller
automatically queues any required automated pings on a queue. Roller
only keeps one ping queue entry for a given user weblog and ping
target. Subsequent updates to a weblog occurring before the ping is
processed will not cause additional pings to be queued. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Roller makes a full pass through the ping queue at
regular intervals. (Configuration of this interval is discussed
below) In each pass, Roller will attempt to send every queued ping
request once. If any send fails (and provided the failure appears to
be a transient one), the ping request will be re-queued, until the
ping succeeds or a configured number of attempts has been made. Note
that when a ping request fails and is re-queued, it is processed
again only on subsequent ping passes. If the number of attempts to
reach a given ping target reaches the maximum without succeeding,
then an error message is logged and the ping request is dropped. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">There is currently no mechanism for alerting users
of failing ping targets (though we plan some improvements in
subsequent releases to provide condition information on the weblog
<B>Preferences-&gt;Pings</B> page, as well as a failure policy to
deactivate persistently failing ping targets).

	default value should work for most sites, and is tolerable for most

	interval determines the length of the queue, and Roller requires
	enough time in an interval to process the queue once. We think that
	for all but the largest and most active sites, it can probably be
	lowered as low as 1 minute if desired. <B>IMPORTANT</B>: The value 0
	(zero) has a special meaning. If the processing interval is set to

(by setting the processing interval to zero) in this situation.

<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><B>STEP1: Enable the Planet
aggregator </B></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Set  <FONT FACE="Courier New">planet.aggregator.enabled=true</FONT>

<P CLASS="western">Enter a valid cache directory in the
<FONT FACE="Courier New">planet.aggregator.cache.dir</FONT> property
of your Roller properties override file. Make sure the cache
directory exists and is writable by the user who owns the Roller
process.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><B>STEP 2: Obtain a Technorati
license (optional)</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you'd like to
display Technorati rankings for the weblogs in Planet Roller, you'll
need a Technorati key. You can get an API key free-of-charge from the
Technorati Developer Center. Place the API key in a file (with no
whitespace) named <FONT FACE="Courier New">technorati.license</FONT>
and place that license in the <FONT FACE="Courier New">WEB-INF/classes</FONT>
directory of your Roller install.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><B>STEP 3: Setup the refresh-entries
task</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western">The RefreshEntriesTask is responsible for updating
each of the blogs in the Planet aggregator. You should set it up to
run every hour. There are two ways to do this. You can add it to the
list of hourly tasks run by Roller's built-in scheduler by adding the
following to your Roller properties override file:</P>
<P CLASS="western">   <FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2># Comma

<P CLASS="western">  
<FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>tasks.hourly=org.apache.roller.planet.tasks.RefreshEntriesTask</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western">However, some folks have found that the
RefreshEntriesTask can works best when run outside of Roller. If you
want to do that instead, you can use cron on UNIX or Windows Task
scheduler to run the task. For UNIX users, use the rollertask.sh
script which can be found in the Roller install directory under
docs/examples. You'll have to modify it to set your paths and your
JDBC driver jar.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><B>STEP 4: Setup the sync-websites
task</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western">The SyncWebsitesTask ensures that every blog in
the Roller system is included in the Planet aggregator. It is
intended to run every night. Every time that it runs, it adds all new
blogs and removes all blogs that no longer exist. If you have a valid
technorati.license file your classpath, it will also rank the blogs
in the system using the Techorati system. To setup sync-websites, add
the following to your Roller propeties override file.</P>
<P CLASS="western">   <FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2># Daily

<P CLASS="western">As with the refresh-entries tasks, some have found
that sync-websites runs best outside of Roller. You can run it from
cron or Windows Task Scheduler too. And again, UNIX users can use

aggregations from Planet Roller in the page of your Roller weblogs,
but before you do you'll need to do some configuration and you'll
need to add some template code. Let's start with the configuration.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Configuring Planet
Roller page models</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Before you can use
Planet Roller data within weblog pages, you must add <B>PlanetModel</B>
to list of rendering models made available in weblog templates. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You can do this by
creating a <FONT FACE="Courier New">roller-custom.properties</FONT>
file as described in the Roller Installation Guide and overriding one
of the rendering properties. Which one?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you want to make
the PlanetModel available to only the site-wide frontpage weblog,
then you add PlanetModel to the <FONT FACE="Courier New">rendering.siteModels</FONT>
property like so:</FONT></P>

add it to the rendering.pageModels property like so:</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Using PlanetModel
in your weblog pages</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If your Roller site
has a site-wide frontpage weblog and it uses the frontpage theme,
then customize your theme (as described in the Template Guide). Edit
the Weblog page. Comment out the weblog entry pager and un-comment
the planet aggregation pager in the following code:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>##
The below pager code should work against either:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>##
1) SITE-WIDE entries</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in">    <FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>##
set($pager = $site.getWeblogEntriesPager($since, $maxResults))</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>##
2) PLANET-entries</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in">    <FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>#set($pager
= $planet.getAggregationPager($since, $maxResults))</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By doing that, the
frontpage will display planet entries instead of site-wide entries on
the front page. That's not all you can do. You can display custom
aggregation groups, Technorati rankings and more. For more
information on the PlanetModel, refer to the Template Guide.<BR><BR>
