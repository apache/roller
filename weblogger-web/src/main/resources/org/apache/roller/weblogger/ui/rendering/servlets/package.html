Roller rendering system servlets.

    <h2>Roller Servlets</h2>
    
    Most rendering servlets work like this:
    <ul>
        <li>Create a request object to parse the request</li>
        <li>Determine last modified time, return not-modified (HTTP 304) if possible</li>
        <li>Return content from cache if possible</li>
        <li>Load model objects into a map suitable for renderer</li>
        <li>Call most appropriate renderer to render content</li>
    </ul>
